The Glossom Plugin allows Glossom users to create a lively Collection Cover within the post of a WP blog

== Description ==

The Glossom Plugin allows Glossom users to create a lively Collection Cover within the post of a WP blog.  
The user can have:  
- a preview of each single item in The Collection Cover posted on WP  
- a complete view of each single Collection Cover Item in Glossom just clicking on the Collection Item thumbnail in WP  

== Installation ==

1. Put glossom_collections folder into your /wp-content/plugins folder
2. Enable the glossom_collections plugin in the "Plugins" sections of the Wordpress administration panel

There are two ways to include a collection in a post.

1. Using the glossom_collections button:
    After the plugin installation, a new button is available in the editor toolbar.
    Its icon is the Glossom 'g' character. 
    By clicking on it, the collection id is asked and the post content is updated with the right include code

2. Manually inclusion:
    Just enter [glossom_collection COLL_ID] replacing COLL_ID with the id number of the collection.
